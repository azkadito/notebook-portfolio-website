# Notebook-Style Personal Website Documentation

## Project Overview

This project creates a personal website for a Statistics and Data Science Master's student with a unique notebook-inspired design that incorporates computer/terminal aesthetics. The website serves as both a portfolio for job hunting and a creative expression of the creator's approach to data science.

### Core Concept

The site resembles a data science notebook (like Jupyter Notebook) reimagined as a full website with several key innovations:

1. **Side-by-side layout**: Code cells and their outputs appear next to each other rather than stacked
2. **Interactive code elements**: Code elements (variables, functions, comments) are clickable and serve as navigation
3. **Computer/terminal aesthetics**: Terminal-inspired colors, monospace fonts, typing animations, and terminal-style UI
4. **Data exploration experience**: Users can explore information about you as if they were a data scientist analyzing datasets

### Design Philosophy

- **Computer terminal aesthetic**: Retro-styled interface with terminal colors, scan lines, and pixel textures
- **Playful yet thoughtful**: Fun and creative while demonstrating technical proficiency
- **Dark theme**: Easy on the eyes with bold accent colors inspired by terminal displays
- **Unorthodox approach**: Shows creativity and technical ability simultaneously
- **Data scientist experience**: Makes visitors feel like they're exploring datasets about you

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Content**: Structured JSON data for exploration experience
- **Animations**: CSS animations for typing effects and blinking cursors

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Modularity Principle

All code in this project follows strict modularity principles:

1. **File Size Limit**: Each file is kept under 500 lines of code
2. **Component Isolation**: Components have single responsibilities and are reusable
3. **Split Logic**: Complex functionality is separated into multiple files

This approach is essential for:
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify smaller components
- **Collaboration**: Different developers can work on isolated parts
- **AI Assistance**: When working with AI tools that have output limits, keeping files modular prevents having to regenerate entire large files
- **Iterative Development**: Easier to update individual components without affecting the whole system

### Key Components

#### Exploration Components

1. **ExplorationCell**: The core component that renders code cells with typing animation and interactive elements
   - Features:
     - Side-by-side layout for code and output (1:3 ratio)
     - Typing animation for code
     - Interactive elements within code
     - Output appears after typing completes

2. **ExplorationNotebook**: Container component that manages exploration cells
   - Features:
     - Handles state for multiple cells
     - Manages interactions between cells
     - Creates new cells based on user actions
     - Provides reset functionality

#### Design Details

##### Color Scheme

The design uses a dark theme with terminal-inspired accent colors:
- Background: Very dark blue (`#0c0c18`)
- Cell backgrounds: `#151528` (main), `#0c0c18` (code), `#101020` (output)
- Accent colors: 
  - Terminal Green (`#00ff88`) - Primary, used for success states and keywords
  - Terminal Blue (`#4cc9f0`) - Secondary, used for functions and highlighting
  - Terminal Amber (`#ffc400`) - Warning, used for alerts and comments
  - Terminal Red (`#ff5555`) - Danger, used for errors and critical information

##### Typography

- Monospace font (Fira Code) for all text to maintain the computer terminal aesthetic
- Consistent text scale with responsive adjustments
- Cursor animations on code cells

##### Interactive Elements

Code cells contain three types of interactive elements:
- **Keywords**: Variables and parameters (green background, '>' prefix)
- **Functions**: Method and function names (blue background, '()' suffix)
- **Comments**: Code comments (gray background, '#' prefix)

Each has distinct styling, hover effects, and tooltips to indicate interactivity.

##### Animations

Several animations enhance the computer terminal feel:
- **Typing effect**: Text appears character by character
- **Blinking cursor**: Cursor blinks at the end of typing animations
- **Hover effects**: Interactive elements glow and lift slightly when hovered

## Exploration Interface Details

### Data Scientist Experience Concept

The exploration interface is designed to make users feel like data scientists exploring information about you:

1. **Conceptual Model**:
   - Users are presented with datasets about you (skills, projects, education, etc.)
   - They navigate by selecting variables and executing "functions" in code cells
   - Each interaction generates a new cell with results and further exploration options
   - The exploration maintains a logical flow that preserves context

2. **Dataset Structure**:
   - Each dataset has a name, description, and items array
   - Items contain relevant information and potential relations to other datasets
   - Relations allow users to navigate between related information

3. **Cell Types**:
   - **Initial cell**: Shows available datasets
   - **Dataset cell**: Shows overview of a selected dataset
   - **Detail cell**: Shows detailed view of a specific item

### Implementation Approach

The exploration interface uses a clean, simplified implementation approach:

1. **State Management**:
   - Cells are stored in a single state array
   - New cells are added based on user interactions
   - Each cell contains code, output, and interactive elements

2. **Typing Animation**:
   - Uses `setTimeout` for character-by-character typing
   - Displays interactive elements as they're typed
   - Shows blinking cursor during typing
   - Reveals output after typing completes

3. **Interaction Handling**:
   - Interactive elements trigger actions when clicked
   - Actions generate new cells with relevant content
   - Related datasets provide navigation between different information

4. **Styling**:
   - Consistent terminal-inspired styling
   - Clear visual distinction between input and output
   - Responsive layout that works on various screen sizes

   - Implement terminal commands to navigate the site

3. **Dynamic Code Generation**:
   - Generate more complex and varied code examples based on user actions
   - Create more realistic data science workflow demonstrations

4. **Code Execution Simulation**:
   - Simulate code execution with realistic timing and output generation
   - Add "errors" and debugging as part of the narrative
